                    Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, is a former captain of the Indian cricket team and one of the best batsmen in the world. Kohli is known for his extraordinary consistency, aggressive captaincy, and match-winning performances.
                    Over the years, he has become the face of Indian cricket, breaking numerous records across all formats of the game.

                    Kohliâ€™s cricket journey started as a young boy playing for the Delhi Under-15 team. His breakthrough moment came in 2008, when he led India to victory in the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup as captain. From there, he quickly rose through the ranks, debuting for the Indian senior team later that year.

                    As a batsman, Kohli has been unparalleled, scoring over 70 international centuries, a feat achieved by only a few in cricketing history. He holds numerous records, including being the fastest to 8,000, 9,000, and 10,000 ODI runs. His passion for fitness has inspired a revolution in Indian cricket's approach to physical training.
